# Welcome to the JDL demo
### Made during the very first JHipster conf

In this repo you'll find the made demos made during this talk.
Instructions on how to reproduce the demos are given inside the 
`phaseX` folders.

There was a third demo, but due to the state of the committed code, 
I've decided to remove it. Don't worry, the JDLLinter feature will be 
available very soon.

To run these demos, you'll need JHipster v5 (for application 
generation).
