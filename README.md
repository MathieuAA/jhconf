# Welcome to the JDL demo
### Made during the very first JHipster conf

In this repo you'll find the made demos made during this talk.
Instructions on how to reproduce the demos are given inside the 
`phaseX` folders.

There was a third demo, but due to the state of the committed code, 
I've decided to remove it. Don't worry, the JDLLinter feature will be 
available very soon.
